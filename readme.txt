Drain Hole is a centralized download manager with full monitoring, statistics, versioning, SVN support, and proper SEO download URLs (no nasty query parameters)

== Description ==

Drain Hole is a centralized download manager, with full monitoring and statistics, versioning, SVN support, and SEO download URLs (no more nasty query strings!).

In addition to it's monitoring abilities, Drain Hole has a run-time tag replacement feature that lets you embed special tags in your post which are replaced with information from Drain Hole. For example, you can embed download URLs, version information, last update times etc. Whenever you change a downloadable file it is automatically updated throughout your blog, without you needing to change anything else.

Features include:

* SEO download URLs - a unique feature that allows files to look like real links
* SVN support - attach a file directly to an SVN repository and have the contents automatically updated
* Versioning - maintain multiple versions of a file, allowing users to download older files
* Full download statistics, including number of downloads, access times, referrer, and download speed, available as CSV and Flash-based graphs
* Download security - permissions can be assigned to downloads (including Flash files), restricting them to WordPress roles
* Template tags - insert dynamic download data into posts, and into the sidebar as a Widget
* Hot-link protection
* Fully localized
